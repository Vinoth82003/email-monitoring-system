# Email Monitoring System

The Email Monitoring System is an intelligent solution designed to alleviate email overload and ensure timely attention to critical communications. It offers a range of features to help users manage their emails more effectively.

## Scope of the Project

The proposed project aims to develop an intelligent email monitoring system with the following key features:

### Email Integration

The system seamlessly integrates with popular email service providers, allowing users to connect their email accounts securely.

### Priority Identification

Advanced algorithms analyze incoming emails to identify important messages based on user-defined criteria such as keywords, sender reputation, or specific email threads.

### Notification Mechanism

Important emails trigger notifications through multiple channels, including email alerts and SMS messages to the user's registered mobile number. Notifications persist until the user acknowledges or responds to the email.

### Customization Options

Users can customize notification preferences and fine-tune criteria for identifying important emails, including setting filters, defining priority levels, and configuring notification schedules.

### User Interface

The system features an intuitive and user-friendly interface accessible via web or mobile applications. It provides clear visibility into the user's email inbox, highlighting important emails and facilitating quick action.

### Security and Privacy

Robust security measures, including encryption of sensitive information, adherence to industry-standard security protocols, and compliance with data protection regulations, safeguard user data and maintain confidentiality.

### Performance Optimization

The system is optimized for efficiency and reliability, ensuring minimal latency in email processing and notification delivery. It includes features to mitigate the impact of slow internet connections or network disruptions.

### Feedback Mechanism

Users can provide feedback on the accuracy and effectiveness of the email prioritization and notification system, which will be used to continuously refine and improve performance.
